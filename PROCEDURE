Procedure for making RF Transmitter
Requirement:Ardiuno,Breadboard,wires,RF Transmitter.
Procedure:
1.We have to connect VCC pin to the 5V powersource in Arduino.
2.Connecting Ground pin to the Ground of Arduino.
3.Data pin of the Transmitter should be connected to any Digital Pin(in our case -12)
4.For long distances we can use an antenna(wounded wire)
(All these connections are done through jumperwires).
