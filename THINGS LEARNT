I learnt what is RF Transmitter and how it is used.
It is used to transmit data between two devices without wires or through wireless communication.
We can make changes in our code when to transfer and when to recieve and also we can filterout which data we want to recieve.
It has many applications in our daily life like RC cars, remotes etc
